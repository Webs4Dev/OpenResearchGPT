# OpenResearchGPT

OpenResearchGPT is an open-source multi-agent research discovery and analysis platform designed to help users find, understand, rank, and interact with research papers from multiple sources.

Unlike traditional paper search tools, OpenResearchGPT focuses on explainability and research understanding — helping users discover relevant papers, understand *why* they matter, and connect research findings directly to their own projects.

## Core Features

### Multi-Source Research Retrieval

Retrieve research papers from multiple academic sources:

- arXiv
- Semantic Scholar
- PubMed
- OpenAlex
- CrossRef
- Government research portals
- University repositories
- Additional web-based sources

---

### Web Retrieval Agent

Discover research papers from websites that do not provide APIs or official Python libraries.

Examples:

- Government research portals
- Research lab websites
- University repositories
- Organization publications

---

### Paper Ranking Agent

Rank research papers using multiple factors:

- Semantic similarity
- Recency
- Citation count
- Methodology similarity
- Source quality
- Project relevance

---

### Explanation Agent

Explain *why* a paper was recommended.

Example:

**Paper:** *Memory Architectures for LLM Agents*

**Why it was selected:**

- Matches multi-agent memory systems
- Strong methodology overlap
- Recent publication
- High semantic similarity

---

### PDF Deep Dive Agent

Upload a research paper and let the system:

- Identify important sections
- Highlight useful content
- Explain difficult concepts
- Answer questions
- Connect research ideas to your project

---

### Citation-Aware RAG

Interact with research papers through conversational retrieval while preserving citations and contextual understanding.

---

## Planned Features

- Research gap detection
- Automated literature review generation
- Fine-tuned explanation model (LoRA)
- Personalized research memory
- Citation graph visualization
- Model evaluation pipeline
- Local model support
- PDF highlighting generation
